# Refinement_7_9
This is the code for paper "Reading acquisition refines phonological processing in the inferior frontal cortex from 7- to 9-year-old children" by Jin Wang, Julia Pines, Marc F. Joanisse, James R. Booth. Most of the codes needed for this paper are the same as the scaffolding_5_7 repository. https://github.com/wangjinvandy/Scaffolding_5_7.md. So here I only included the codes that are different.

# Preprocessing:


# TPM template:
mkpdtemplate_ELP3.m is the code to make a pediatric template aged from 7 years old to 10.5 years old.
